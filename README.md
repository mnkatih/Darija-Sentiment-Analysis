# Darija-Sentiment-Analysis
Collecting and analyzing customer feedback is critical for improving product and service. However, obtaining that feedback can often prove to be a tricky challenge for many businesses. In Morocco and due to the complexity of our Arabic dialect, banks and insurance need to automate sentiment analysis systems in order to be more consumer centric.

The aim of this project is to provide an optimal classifier for sentiment analysis in Arabic dialectal language with reasonable accuracy.
